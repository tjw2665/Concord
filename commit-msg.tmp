  handler(stream, connection) instead of handler({stream, connection})

- Add network diagnostics: periodic net_stats, peer:identify logging,
  send/recv counters, per-peer connection details in sidebar
- Rename application from AntiSurveillanceState to Concord throughout
- Add persistent identity, mDNS discovery, known peer reconnection
